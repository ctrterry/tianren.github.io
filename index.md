## Projects

### Canvas System Optimization
*Collaborated with Professor Dr. Jim D. Pham*  
- Rebuilt and optimized a portion of the Canvas system in C++, enhancing its framework with new features and improved performance.  
- Conducted system analysis to identify weaknesses (lack of modularity) and designed a more modular architecture for maintainability.  
- Developed key components—rendering engine, input handler, and object manager—resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.  
- Leveraged advanced C++ features (pointers, memory management) to boost performance.  
- Delivered a more efficient and flexible Canvas system, gaining hands-on experience in teamwork, technical problem-solving, and project management.

### Web Application with OAuth Integration and Database Management
- Developed a full-stack web application using **Node.js, Express, SQLite, and Handlebars** for managing user-generated posts and profiles.  
- Implemented **Google OAuth 2.0** authentication via Passport.js for secure user login and registration.  
- Built custom APIs for fetching and displaying data (including emojis) from third-party services using `fetch`.

### Digital Design of CPU and Cache Systems
- Developed CPU and cache architectures using logic gates and digital design techniques.  
- Applied logic-based approaches to optimize memory access and data flow within the cache.  
- Conducted simulations to test and validate performance, ensuring reliability and functionality.

### Operating System Project: Distributed File System with Multi-threading and File Distribution
- Designed and implemented a **multi-threaded distributed file system** in C++ to handle concurrent file operations more efficiently.  
- Utilized threads and synchronization primitives (mutexes, condition variables) to ensure thread-safe operations and prevent race conditions in shared resources.  
- Developed HTTP/REST API handlers (GET, PUT, DELETE) for files and directories.  
- Implemented a thread pool and FIFO scheduling policy to manage concurrent requests, optimizing resource utilization.  
- Maintained data consistency and fault tolerance via transactional operations (begin, rollback, commit) on disk.

### Database System Project: L-Store Implementation
- **Single-Threaded, In-memory L-Store**: Built a foundational in-memory database using L-Store architecture with base/tail pages for efficient data storage; implemented SQL-like operations (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).  
- **Durability**: Added disk persistence with transactional operations (begin, rollback, commit) to ensure data consistency and crash recovery; introduced a merge process to optimize read performance by consolidating base and tail pages.  
- **Multi-threading**: Introduced concurrent processing with a thread pool and synchronization primitives to handle simultaneous transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) queries.
**Code of Durable Database:** <a href="https://github.com/ctrterry/Durable-LStore-Database?tab=readme-ov-file#multi-threaded-in-memory--durable-l-store-database" target="_blank"><strong> Click Here to Database</strong></a> <br>

### Power Distribution System Installation and Maintenance
- Designed and implemented power supply and distribution systems, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.  
- Conducted hands-on installation and maintenance of electrical systems, troubleshooting real-world faults.  
- Applied safety practices to protect systems and personnel, focusing on reliable power delivery.
